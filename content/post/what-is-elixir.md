Elixir is a *powerful, dynamic functional language.* which features
*meta-programming* capabilities. It can be used to create highly scalable web
applications, and has uses for machine learning and potentially artificial
intelligence - and is very easy to use.

Elixir uses the Erlang VM to achieve its super low latency results and has
exceptional support for fault-tolerance. Everything in Elixir is a macro, which
may be a new idea to some new-comers to the Elixir world.
